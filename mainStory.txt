Hello. How have you been? Working for "Cam-Corp" is still fun. It has been great here. People are very nice here and I have fit in really good in here.
Although, I have a feeling something else is happening here.. People keep going into this inclosed room next to my table. I can not see what it is but
I keep seeing bright lights come into the room at different times... Weird lights. Ones I have never seen before... Anyways I hope you are 
having fun! I will see you soon. Love (Input name)
