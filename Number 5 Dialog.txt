1) The teleporter is at the top left of the lab
2) The note can really help you out
Hope you find what you are looking for !!"

As you walk up to the help desk, you see a buisness card with the name of (set name)
"Oh wow, you made it.. I am surprised you made it past the traps.. Must be nice. A lot of people do not coming through the teleporter anymore.
They are trying to keep people away now. You are the first person I have seen in a LONG time. Just remember how you did that to get out. Just do the
opposite.. Anyways, I have things I need to tell you.
1) Health regeneration is somewhere on the left wall of the lab
2) There are more traps than you have seen so BE CAREFUL
3) There is something special at the bottom of the lab closer to this room
Be careful out there! It is getting worse.. I can't even walk here anymore without worrying about my life."
